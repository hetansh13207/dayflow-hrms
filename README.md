# dayflow-hrms

### I built Dayflow HRMS for the Odoo Hackathon with a strong focus on backend fundamentals rather than just visuals. In the beginning, the UI/UX wasn’t great — it was pretty rough — because I prioritized session management, authentication, role-based access control, login/signup validation, and overall security. I wanted the system to be logically solid and functionally correct first. I took guidance to improve implementation details and make the application more stable and production-safe. Although the project wasn’t selected, it was a huge learning experience for me. Later, I collaborated with a friend to enhance the UI/UX and polish the frontend while keeping the strong backend foundation intact.

## Thank You!
